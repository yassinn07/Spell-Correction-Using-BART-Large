# Project Title: Fine-Tuning a Transformer Model for Spelling Correction

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a robust spelling correction system by fine-tuning a pre-trained Transformer model. The goal is to automatically detect and correct spelling errors in English sentences, a crucial component for enhancing written communication across various platforms.

## Dataset

The model was trained and evaluated using a subset of the **WikiSplit dataset**. This dataset, derived from Wikipedia edits, provides a large corpus of well-formed English sentences. For this project, we utilized the following files:

* `tune.tsv`
* `validation.tsv`
* `test.tsv`

Specifically, only the first column of these tab-separated value (TSV) files, containing single, unsplit sentences, was used as the source of correctly spelled sentences.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Generation and Preparation

* **Loading Sentences:** The initial step involved loading the correct sentences from the provided dataset files.
* **Generating Misspelled Sentences:** To create a supervised learning dataset, misspelled versions of the correct sentences were programmatically generated. This process involved introducing random spelling errors into one or more words within each sentence, employing various techniques to simulate realistic mistakes.
* **Dataset Creation:** The generated misspelled sentences were then paired with their corresponding original, correct sentences to form the training, validation, and testing datasets.
* **Preprocessing:** Standard data preparation and preprocessing techniques were applied to format the data appropriately for the Transformer model. This included tokenization and any other model-specific requirements.

### 2. Model Fine-Tuning

* **Transformer Architecture:** A pre-trained Transformer model (either **BART** or **T5** architecture) was selected as the base for fine-tuning.
* **Training:** The chosen model was fine-tuned on the prepared training dataset, optimizing it for the task of sequence-to-sequence spelling correction (transforming a misspelled sentence into a corrected one).
* **Overfitting Mitigation:** During the training process, various strategies were explored and implemented to address potential overfitting, ensuring the model generalizes well to unseen data.

### 3. Evaluation

* **Metrics:** The performance of the fine-tuned spelling correction model was rigorously evaluated on the held-out test dataset.
* **Selected Metrics:** At least two distinct and suitable metrics for evaluating spelling correction systems were chosen and implemented. These metrics provide quantitative insights into the model's accuracy and effectiveness in identifying and correcting errors. *(Specific metrics used would be detailed in the project's report or code).*
